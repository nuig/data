We use this repository to store some of our publications and made them available on our [website](https://nuig.github.io/publications).

**Do you want to provide a pdf file for any of the publications listed [here](https://nuig.github.io/publications)?**

You just need to find the bibtex `key` for the [paper](https://github.com/nuig/nuig.github.io/blob/src/_bibliography/autogen_all.bib), rename it to `key.pdf` and push it here. The webpage will be automatically updated for you.
